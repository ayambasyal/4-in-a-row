## what game is it?
Four in a Row is a two-player connection board game, in which the players take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The first player to achieve a line of four connected discs of their own color wins the game.

## how to play in your machine ?
for windows user, clone the repo/ download the repo then open the release folder within which you will find 4-in-a-row.exe executable file, run it and you can play the game.

for apple user, the executable is not present so you need to make an executable for yourself, for it you will need to set up C++ with SFML (preferably in visual studio ), sorry for the inconvenience
